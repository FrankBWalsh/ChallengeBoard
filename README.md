ChallengeBoard
==============

The challenge board project aims to be an open source ladder system that can be used to run any number of competitive events.  If you can compete against a single an opponent, you can can have a challenge board.

Competitors can move up and down on the board by playing amongst each other and submitting the results.  Standings are currently calculated using a standard Chess ELO algorthym.

Requirements
============

- ASP.NET 4.5
- .NET 4.0
- SQL Server 

- Recaptcha keys: http://www.google.com/recaptcha.  Recently I've needed to add protection against spammers, so Polite Recatpcha is now being used.  You can develop on localhost, but moving to production will require a set of keys.
