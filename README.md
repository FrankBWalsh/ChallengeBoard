ChallengeBoard
==============

The challenge board project aims to be an open source ladder system that can be used to run any number of competitive events.  If you can compete against a single an opponent, you can can have a challenge board.

Competitors can move up and down on the board by playing amongst each other and submitting the results.  Standings are currently calculated using a standard Chess ELO algorthym.

Requirements
============

- ASP.NET 4.5
- .NET 4.0
- SQL Server (you optionally can swap in a different provider)

At this time, I don't believe that mono supports the asyc pipeline that ASP.NET 4.5 requires.
