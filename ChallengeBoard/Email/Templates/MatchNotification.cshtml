        Hello @Model.LoserName,
    </p>
    <p>
        We're just dropping you a line to let you know that <strong>@Model.WinnerName</strong> has reported a match with you on the 
        <strong>@Model.BoardName</strong> challenge board.  If this is accurate, there isn't anything you have to do.  
        If this is in err, head on over to reject the match so that it will not count.  You have <strong>@Model.AutoVerifies</strong> 
        hour(s) to reject this match.
    </p>
